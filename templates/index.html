  <h2>Pilot Project</h2>
      
  <p>In 2014, a pilot was conducted between The STEM School in Chattanooga and the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles. Students at STEM were able to conduct personalized research with locally collected, live specimens under the instruction of Tennessee Science Educator of the year, Shannon Sigel, as well as receive input and guidance from Dr. Richard Weinberg, research professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts, and inventor of the 4k tele-microscopy project.

      <h2>Tele-Microscopy</h2>
      <p>During the summer of 2016, TelemeterED is scaling the 4k Microscope experience to implement the platform in 5 school in Chattanooga, TN. The system gives students and teachers remote access and control to a 4k microscope, allowing them to conduct experiments with live specimens on a research-grade digital, motorized microscope and view and store the video data at ultra-high resolutions.
